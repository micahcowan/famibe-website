<h1>Welcome to Family Basic!</h1>
<h2>What is Family Basic [Famibe]?</h2>
<p>Family Basic is an add-on for the Japanese Family Computer, or
“Famicom” (Japanese version of the NES), consisting of an attachable
keyboard, and a cartridge containing the BASIC programming language,
developed by Nintendo in Collaboration with Sharp and Hudson (Family
Basic identifies itself as NS-HUBASIC at start-up).</p>
<p>Maybe having BASIC and a keyboard entitles the Famicom to its claim
of being a “Family Computer”?</p>
<p>While language limitations, and very limited memory (2k or 4k,
including program listing and data) make Famibe poorly suited for
writing, say, a text adventure, it compensates with the ability to use
the Famicom’s graphics hardware to edit and display tiled background
graphics, and control animated sprites, which are moved in a process
concurrent to program logic. Playing sound, however, blocks program
logic (but supports up to three voices).</p>

<h2>Basics of Navigating and Input in Family Basic</h2>
<p>Instead of typing some unmemorable control-key combination, there is
a dedicated STOP key, above the RETURN key, for terminating a running
program.</p>
<p>If you want to re-run or enter a modification of a line you’ve
already entered, you can simply use the cursor keys to return to that
line, make whatever modifications, and hit the RETURN key again. You do
not need to return the cursor to the end of the line first; simply press
RETURN anywhere on the line to enter it.</p>
<p>Typing overwrites other characters that are present on the line. To
create new space to insert characters, use the INS key. Note that, like
the Commodore 64, the INS key does not toggle between and “insert” and
an “overwrite” mode, but inserts a single space on each keypress.</p>
<p>If, when you type, you’re seeing weird Japanese characters instead of
normal ASCII characters, try hitting the KANA key. There’s no indicator,
and the key doesn’t physically lock down, but the KANA key is a
mode-locking key that toggles between ASCII and Japanese katakana
characters. While in katakana mode, the GRPH key may also be used
together with the top row of keys (only) to generate certain box-drawing
characters that may be used in program listings to draw boxes out of
characters. Aside from toggling the KANA key, you can also type
Control-W to enter ASCII mode (Control-V enters kana mode).</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, the whole screen looks full of garbled images,
try typing Control-D, which restores the default character set for the
screen, turns off sprite display, and restores the default color
palette.</p>
<p>In general, if the screen seems to be in an abnormal state (garbled
screen, weird colors, cursor not showing/not responding to input,
character sprites displayed), try (1) pressing the STOP key, (2) typing
Control-D, and then (3) holding SHIFT while typing the CLR/HOME key.</p>
<p>When typing over existing on-screen text, Control-E or Control-Z may
be useful: Control-E erases from the cursor to end-of-line, Control-Z
erases to end-of-screen.</p>
<h2>Particulars of Family Basic Programming</h2>
<p><b>Integer BASIC.</b> Family Basic is an integer BASIC - all numeric
variables are calculated using 16-bit integer math. No floating
point/decimal support, and any fractional portion of the result of a
division, is discarded.</p>
<p><b>Two-char significance.</b> As with many other implementations of BASIC
for home computers, variable names in Famibe are only distinguished by
the first two characters of their name. Additional characters may be
used, but only the first two actually identify the variable.</p>
<p><b>NEXT only branches for the current innermost loop.</b> This is
probably the most cumbersome point for porting BASIC programs from other
systems: the
NEXT keyword does not accept an optional index variable after it - only
NEXT by itself may be used, not (e.g.) NEXT J. It may therefore be
necessary in some cases to rewrite inner loops as explicit increment
&amp; GOTO/IF combinations.</p>
<p><b>Strings limited to 31 chars!</b> String values - whether in literal form
or created via concatenation, may not exceed 31 characters. The largest
impact of this, especially when porting other BASIC programs, is that
some PRINT statements with a single string argument may need to have
that argument broken up into multiple strings with a semicolon
separator: PRINT "HELLO "; "WORLD"</p>
<p><b>Hexadecimal support.</b> Hexadecimal numeric values may be specified via
the format &amp;H<i>XX</i>.</p>
<p><b>THEN encompasses colon-separated statements.</b> As with Microsoft-based
BASICs, but unlike, say, Woz’s Integer BASIC, the THEN keyword will
include all the rest of the line, including colon-separated statements,
as the conditionally-executed body of the IF statement.</p>
<p><b>Bitwise/logical operators.</b> Since some BASIC implementations lack
them, it’s useful to note that Famibe supports bitwise/logical operators
AND, OR, NOT, and XOR.</p>
<p><b>Machine code calls.</b> This BASIC is capable of exceeding its own
considerable limitations with a CALL command.</p>
<p><b>No lowercase characters.</b></p>
<p><b>Save/load programs.</b> You can save a single program to an AA battery-backed memory (but be careful not to jostle the cartridge while flipping the backup switch!), or you can save the program listing as an audio signal to a mono
cassette recorder.</p>
<p>Contrary to some peoples’ claims, a proprietary Nintendo Data
Recorder cassette deck is not required, and early versions of the manual
note that any  monaural cassette deck (“such as a Sharp QT-10”) may be
used for the purpose.</p>
<p>Also contrary to some claims, the Famicom Disk System may not be used
to save or load programs with Family Basic. Both the Famicom Disk System
and the Family Basic cartridge occupy the cartridge slot in order to
function, and Famicom Disk System disks also lack a filesystem for
storing multiple files, and lack random-access capabilities (because of
the way the data is stored as a single spiral).</p>
<p><b>Save/load data from cartridges!</b> A handful of games supported creating
user levels and saving them to tape using the Family Basic interface to
the cassette recorder. Excitebike, Wrecking Crew, and Loderunner are
among the games to support this feature.</p>
